# TASM DOSBox Assembly Scripting Project

Welcome to the TASM DOSBox Assembly Scripting project! This repository contains a collection of assembly language scripts developed using TASM (Turbo Assembler) in the DOSBox environment. These scripts cover a range of fundamental assembly programming tasks and concepts, making it an excellent resource for those looking to dive into low-level programming.

## Features

This project includes the following assembly language tasks and concepts:

- **Spaces and Word Counting**: Efficiently count the occurrences of spaces and words in a text.

- **Merging Arrays**: Combine and merge arrays into a new array.

- **Summing Arrays**: Calculate the sum of array elements, both in signed and unsigned formats and saves it as a string and byte.

- **Stacks**: Explore the use of stacks for efficient data manipulation.
  
- **Maximum Number**: Find and print maximum signed and unsigned number from the stack.

## Prerequisites

To run the scripts in this project, you'll need:

- [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/): An x86 emulator with DOS.
